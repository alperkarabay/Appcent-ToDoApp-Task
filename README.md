# Appcent-ToDoApp-Task
This is a ToDoApp that is developed for AppCent Tech case study.

USED TECHNOLOGIES: JAVA 17, SPRING DATA, H2 DATABASE, REACT NATIVE, SPRING BOOT, JUNIT AND MOCKITO FOR UNIT TEST
DATABASE ENTITIES: TASKS, LOGS, USERS, ROLES (ROLES AND USERS ARE DEFINED FOR AUTHENTICATION BUT COULDN'T IMPLEMENT YET)

TO BUILD THE APP: YOU MUST BUILD THE POM XML AND RUN THE BACKEND SIDE FROM THE IDE. ALL THE APIS LINKED TO LOCALHOST:8080
                   AFTER RUNNING THE BACKEND SIDE, YOU SHOULD RUN THE FRONTEND SIDE WITH AN IDE THAT SUPPORTS REACT NATIVE 
                   FRONT END SIDE LINKED TO LOCALHOST:3000


TO RUN THE UNIT TESTS: I ADDED UNIT TESTS FOR SOME OF THE SERVICES YOU CAN RUN THEM FROM THE TESTS FOLDER UNDER THE TEST FOLDER

IMPORTANT: SINCE I USED H2 DATABASE THAT IS AN IN MEMORY DATABASE, I LET THE DATABASE URL AS MEM:TESTDB IN APPLICATION PROPERTIES. IF YOU DONT LINK IT TO A FILE IN YOUR COMPUTER, IT WILL RESTART THE DATAS AT EVERY RUN
